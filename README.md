# CS50P 2022 Course `By David J. Malan`

---

These are the codes that I've written and submitted to [***CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python***](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), composed of online classes, slides, and problems to code. 

The course gave access to a platform in conjunction with CodeSpaces and GitHub to code, check and submit files easily and via browser.
