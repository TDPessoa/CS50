"""When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like
 Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of
 text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or
 lowercase."""

"""This was the output of the build-in 'check50' function"""
# :) twttr.py exists
# :) input of Twitter yields output of Twttr
# :) input of "What's your name?" yields output of "Wht's yr nm?"
# :) input of CS50 yields output of CS50
# :) input of PYTHON yields output of PYTHN
